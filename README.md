# DeepStack

![Example Extracted Image](./example_images/result-trimarked.jpg)
This image shows DeepStack's object detector and grouping algo, made using sep and scipy.

(The image in the example dir is taken by me with a raspberry pi 3b+. For more info, check [this repo](https://github.com/n3rdium/AstroPi) out!)
A cross platform deep-sky image stacking program written in python. Built to be fast yet accurate, and user-friendly yet advanced and easily extensible.

This is going to be like N.I.N.A, except it's not for image acquisition, but for the preprocessing, stacking, and post-processing.
It will have a GUI and a CLI, and will be cross-platform.
It'll also have a blender-style processing automation planner.

What's really cool is that you can extend DeepStack yourself! It's extremely modular and easily modifiable, assuming that you know python.
Don't forget to open a PR if you do make something cool!

Do you feel that those annoying satellites and aeroplanes are ruining your subs? Well, DeepStack has a solution for you! It can remove such "outliners" from your stack!
